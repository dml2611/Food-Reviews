"St James Restaurant: Fine Modern British Dining in Picturesque Bushey
",https://www.thefoodaholic.co.uk/2023/11/st-james-restaurant-fine-modern-british-dining-in-picturesque-bushey.html,"extra, certainly, ","St James Restaurant: Fine Modern British Dining in Picturesque Bushey 
Born and bred in London, I moved with my parents when I was around five years old to Bushey in Hertfordshire. A pretty little village, with great connections to central London and it was also where I was schooled. But fast forward 12 years from then, I moved myself back to Pinner, then London in my second property, and have been here ever since. So it came as a surprise when I got an email inviting me to dine at  St James Restaurant in Bushey, which I had been walking past ever since it opened in 1997 in my school uniform. 
Alfonso La Cava opened St James Restaurant in Bushey Village in 1997 and since 2019, his nephew Giammarco Angelilli has taken over the kitchens. Giammarco worked in the city for a while and became head chef of Friends restaurant in Pinner (I also dined here a couple of times in the past) where he won a 1 rosettes award. In 2014 he moved to New York where after 6 months moved to Chicago for a new project. In 2015 he came back to London and in March 2016 opened Osteria Modigliani in Pinner which he sold in 2018.  St James feels like an exciting place to dine at right now and we kicked off our tasting menu with an amuse-bouche of mushroom soup with a truffle foam which was so inviting and warming � the perfect start to our lunch. 
The restaurant offers a lighter lunch menu during the day, an a la carte menu for dinner, Sunday roasts, afternoon tea, delicious cocktails and bottomless brunches � the choices are endless and there�s something for everyone. Our tasting menu comprised of six courses priced at �45 which I thought was a steal (plus there�s a slightly toned-down version for �35) and in London for this quality � you�d be paying double that and more. Plus, there is a private dining room for those business affairs or celebrations. 
I think my favourite dish here (well one of many) was this pan-fried scallops, served with red Thai curry sauce, samphire and cashew nut salad. The scallops were honestly cooked to pure perfection. I�ve had far too many tough and chewy ones in my life (even in some of the best establishments) � but this didn�t let us down. The Thai curry sauce was silky and smooth and the samphire cashew nut salad was a much-welcomed texture. A really beautiful dish, but if I�m being extra picky (because it was so good), the sauce could have had just a little more depth and intensity to linger on the palate. 
Indulge in a culinary masterpiece with the slow-cooked grass-fed ox beef cheek here at St James. Impeccably prepared through slow-cooking techniques, the tender beef is bathed in a velvety port wine reduction, creating a symphony of rich flavors. Served atop a bed of parsnips, apples, and celeriac pearl barley risotto, each bite offers a harmonious blend of sweetness, tartness, and nuttiness. Visually stunning and generously portioned, this dish is a triumph of taste and presentation, providing such a memorable dining experience. The reduction was so glossy and beautiful � it wasn�t the easiest to photograph, reflecting into the lens. I could eat it all over again. 
Let�s talk about the exquisite pan-fried cod. This delectable dish features perfectly cooked cod, paired with chorizo croquettes, cod brandade, and a tantalizing tomato relish. The crowning glory is the wild garlic b�arnaise, adding a burst of aromatic flavors. With a perfect balance of textures and a medley of flavours, this culinary creation is a stunning blend of seafood excellence and creative gastronomy. Who knew such a stellar restaurant was in Bushey! 
I know every dish sounds like my favorite, but as we got further into the tasting menu, portions increased � but we somehow managed to finish all (but one last bite!) of the rump of lamb. Yet another culinary delight, featuring tender slow-cooked lamb, dauphinoise potato, borlotti beans, and honey-glazed carrots. The dish reaches perfection with the addition of a rich chestnut puree and crowned with a luscious tarragon jus. A lifetime on the hips and is worth every single mouthful. 
To finish, we indulged in a decadent chocolate cremeux, a velvety and rich chocolate custard, accompanied by a luscious peanut butter and hazelnut mousse. The dish is elevated with the addition of honeycomb for a delightful crunch, and a scoop of salted caramel ice cream for a perfect balance of sweetness and saltiness. To add a touch of complexity, we top it off with a sprinkling of dark chocolate soil. Prepare for a sensory journey that combines the smoothness of cremeux, the nutty notes of mousse, the crispiness of honeycomb, the creaminess of ice cream, and the depth of dark chocolate soil. Delicious! 
All of Giammarco's restaurant experience has certainly paid off because some of the cooking techniques and flavor combinations here really were beautiful and I only wish I knew such a triumph of a restaurant, that I had passed for years � was a place I didn�t pass, but dine in. St James Restaurant in Bushey is a true haven for those who love food, using some of the finest ingredients available. With its commitment to authenticity, exceptional flavors, impeccable service (thanks to the attentive Tommaso Sassanelli who served us), and charming ambiance, it stands out as a destination where diners can indulge in a memorable and delightful culinary journey. Would we return? We absolutely will be doing so � in the very near future.

"The Crossing: A Delicious Pub in the Heart of Picturesque Barnes
",https://www.thefoodaholic.co.uk/2023/06/the-crossing-a-delicious-pub-in-the-heart-of-picturesque-barnes.html,,"''The Crossing: A Delicious Pub in the Heart of Picturesque Barnes 
I just need to come straight out with it � The Crossing in Barnes is absolutely FABULOUS. I've popped in before and really enjoyed my time, but its latest chef seems to have elevated the cooking here, making for an extremely delightful, Italian-influenced menu. Nestled away on the quiet back streets of Barnes, this pub is surely serving up the best food in the area right now. 
Independently owned, The Crossing is a true neighborhood pub with gorgeous interiors, a sun-drenched garden terrace, and superb staff. It still feels like a pub with locals enjoying a pint or three, but it also feels like a proper restaurant, serving up grownup food, cocktails, and a solid wine list. Whilst we perused over the menu, we tucked into a couple of those delicious and punchy cocktails. 
Led by head chef Riccardo Rizzo, the menu here definitely has a nod to Italy, but with some good old classics to warm the cockles all whilst utilising the best seasonal ingredients. To kick off our meal we tucked into some of their starters. We really couldn�t pick just one favourite, but you must order the cauliflower croquettes because they are like eating fluffy, warm, delicious clouds of goodness with a cauliflower cheese style filling. 
The charcuterie board here is SO good, even the toasted sourdough on it is a joy. Packed to the brim with Finocchiona salami & Cobble Lane Pork coppa and cornichons, this would be a great little partner to a pint of beer in the sunshine. 
If you�re extra peckish, order another pint and their burrata because it�s some of the finest I've tried in London. 
It gets better still, honestly. No doubt packed with a million calories, their rigatoni cacio e pepe is the stuff of dreams. The pasta cooked the perfect side of al dente and with enough cheese to scare your arteries � this may well become the dish that has locals coming back for more. 
For mains, I ordered the grass-fed flat iron steak. With the best homemade chips cooked in duck fat and served with a little kale � the rich and glossy jus smothered over it all really makes this dish for me a real standout and one I�d love to have again. The meat is of course, perfectly cooked, packed with flavour and with a nice crispy char on the outside. 
The big surprise for me was the pearl barley. When I'm trying to be a little healthier or want something lighter, I always give this a go but time after time it�s poorly cooked, lacking in flavour, and quite frankly � a little dull. Well, not here. Instead, it�s juicy and full of texture and with its added ingredients � absolutely packed with flavour. 
To finish, heavenly desserts. Perhaps not the time of year for it � but I�ll always find an excuse to tuck into a sticky toffee pudding � especially when they�re this good. Rich, decadent, luscious � I�ve run out of descriptors. With a scoop of clotted cream ice cream to melt over the top � this is the time when you need an espresso martini or a glass of something sweet to wash it down. 
For something more summery, order the panna cotta with lavender, strawberries and biscuit crumb. I�ve never really been the biggest fan of this pudding, with its wet, wobbly texture � but this was slightly firmer in texture (more posset-like), but just as wobbly. I loved the hints of lavender and the sweet strawberries complimented it beautifully. 
Having previously lived in Barnes, I've always loved coming back and I think I�ve found yet another reason not to leave it so long. Chef Riccardo Rizzo really is an asset to the kitchen here at The Crossing and is serving up some stellar food right now in what is a gorgeous little pub. Would we come back? Absolutely.

"Kanishka Restaurant Review: A Modern Taste of India in Mayfair
",https://www.thefoodaholic.co.uk/2023/07/kanishka-restaurant-review-a-modern-taste-of-india-in-mayfair.html,,"''Kanishka Restaurant Review: A Modern Taste of India in Mayfair 

Located on Maddox Street in London and neighboring some of the capital�s best designer shops, hotels and restaurants, Kanishka aims to offer modern, Pan-Indian cuisine that showcases the regional variety of Indian food. With Kanishka coming from one of the UK�s most celebrated chefs, Atul Kochhar � expectations were rather high. Having left Benares in Mayfair back in 2018, it seems Atul has built himself up quite an empire since and I�m so glad because he always brings such excitement and modern flare to his menus. 

As you arrive from the street, you�re greeted by large, beautiful antique-looking wooden doors, but step inside and you�re transported to an uber-modern setting like something out of the latest design book. A striking twisted ceiling, black and white striped walls and pops of aqua blue adorning mirrors which make this place seem much larger than it actually is. 

To kick off proceedings we soaked up our surroundings, took in all the modern glamour, and sipped on a chilled glass of something sparkling, along with some lovely little canapes which really got our taste buds salivating. 

We ate from their early bird set menu which was priced at 3 courses for �40 or dinner, �54. My chosen starter was one of the restaurant�s signature dishes � Atul�s chicken tikka pie. Perfectly crisp on the outside, juicy morsels of meat on the inside and spiced to absolute perfection. This pie does come with a supplement on the set menu, but it�s well worth it for the extra treat and to get a real sense of what to expect from Atul�s cooking. 

For mains, I highly recommend you order the pan-fried salmon. Like most of the food here, the fish was beautifully cooked. Well marinated, moist and a lovely charred skin which was complete with that much hoped-for crunch. On the side, a sweet banana fritter, but the sauce is what really made this dish sing, A rich, thick and glossy Mappas curry that originates from Kerala. It�s the one place that�s always been on my travel bucket list because their fish curries and pristine blue waters are so renowned across the world. 

All of the sides were excellent too and in fact, they could have been a meal on their own (also the reason I forgot to photograph them all). Fluffy steamed rice, the most heavenly saag makai paneer (tender paneer and corn with spiced spinach curry), aubergine and capsicum curry and a garlic naan � because you�ll need the latter to mop it all up with. 

To finish (but with barely any room left) � cr�me brul�e. This one was laced with ginger & mango, topped off with a thin shortbread stick, a touch of biscuit crumble and drops of berry gel. The texture of this brulee was spot on and everything else simply made for a lovely ending to our early dinner set menu. 

I really enjoyed our meal here at Kanishka and it�s great to see Atul and his team continuing to light up the London dining scene. The food here although modern, still feels thoroughly Indian, but perhaps spice levels could be increased ever so slightly in dishes overall if I was really being truly picky. Kanishka is a great addition to add to your visit list if you love Indian food and personally, I can�t wait to see how the menus progress and change over the seasons. Would we come back? Yes � but perhaps I�ll tuck into the a la carte next time to get a real taste of what Kanishka really has up its sleeves.

Perfectly crisp on the outside, juicy morsels of meat on the inside and spiced to absolute perfection.
Like most of the food here, the fish was beautifully cooked.
To finish (but with barely any room left) � cr�me brul�e.
For mains, I highly recommend you order the pan-fried salmon.
Would we come back?'''","''Kanishka aims to offer modern, Pan-Indian cuisine that showcases the regional variety of Indian food.
With Kanishka coming from one of the UK�s most celebrated chefs, Atul Kochhar � expectations were rather high.
As you arrive from the street, you�re greeted by large, beautiful antique-looking wooden doors, but step inside and you�re transported to an uber-modern setting.
A striking twisted ceiling, black and white striped walls and pops of aqua blue adorning mirrors make this place seem much larger than it actually is.
We ate from their early bird set menu which was priced at 3 courses for �40 or dinner, �54.
My chosen starter was one of the restaurant�s signature dishes � Atul�s chicken tikka pie.
This pie does come with a supplement on the set menu, but it�s well worth it for the extra treat and to get a real sense of what to expect from Atul�s cooking.
For mains, I highly recommend you order the pan-fried salmon.
 On the side, a sweet banana fritter, but the sauce is what really made this dish sing, A rich, thick and glossy Mappas curry that originates from Kerala.
All of the sides were excellent too and in fact, they could have been a meal on their own.
To finish (but with barely any room left) � cr�me brul�e.
This one was laced with ginger & mango, topped off with a thin shortbread stick, a touch of biscuit crumble and drops of berry gel.
The texture of this brulee was spot on and everything else simply made for a lovely ending to our early dinner set menu.
The food here although modern, still feels thoroughly Indian, but perhaps spice levels could be increased ever so slightly in dishes overall if I was really being truly picky.
Kanishka is a great addition to add to your visit list if you love Indian food and personally, I can�t wait to see how the menus progress and change over the seasons.'''"
"Chakra Little Venice: Modern Indian Cooking in London�s Prettiest Waterside Location
",https://www.thefoodaholic.co.uk/2022/04/chakra-little-venice-modern-indian-cooking-london.html,,"''Chakra Little Venice: Modern Indian Cooking in London�s Prettiest Waterside Location 

You may or may not have noticed, but I have a bit of a soft spot for Chakra in Kensington and so when I found out they had a shiny new site in Little Venice � I snapped up the opportunity to visit. The new space is looking gorgeous inside and location-wise, it is perfectly placed in such a relaxing and tranquil part of the Little Venice area, surrounded by quaint cafes and cherry blossom trees. 

We sat down at our table, perused the menu and ordered a bottle of red wine that was recommended by the team and went down a treat. They don�t seem to be serving cocktails at this site, but being familiar with the Chakra brand, I definitely think they should as they always do them so well. With our glass of wine in hand, we tucked into what every Indian meal must and always should start with � a selection of papadums and homemade chutneys. All of the yoghurts, chutneys and papadums here were excellent and we left nothing but empty pots behind. The mango chutney in particular was great. 

Another excellent choice here was the Lucknowi samosa chaat. Two huge Punjabi style samosas, sat on a mouth-watering bed of spiced chickpeas, topped with mint, tamarind, yoghurt and sev. Samosa chaat is one of my favourite Indian dishes and they really did it justice here, smothered in lots of sauce and the samosas had the perfect crunch. 

A dish that no visit to Chakra should be without (there�s going to be a lot of these) is the chilli chicken. Succulent morsels of lightly battered shredded chicken, sauteed with pepper, fresh chilli and spring onions. It�s a really lovely plate of food and portion-wise it was very generous � so make sure you come hungry. This dish felt very Indo-Chinese to me � something I�m really enjoying seeing more of on Indian restaurant menus across the capital over the last few years. 

If I had to pick a single dish I absolutely love ordering when dining in an Indian restaurant, it would be paneer tikka (cottage cheese). Here it was marinated in a thick coating of spices and served with slices of mixed peppers and onions � which were all grilled to perfection. The paneer tikka was perfectly cooked meaning not an ounce of chewiness insight and each mouthful was incredibly mouthwatering as those flavours and smears of dipping sauces tantalised the taste buds. 

The star of the show had to be this colourful lamb biryani. Not only was it beautiful to look at, dressed with edible flowers and pomegranate � but the smell when it arrived at the table was so aromatic and filled our noses with notes of saffron and other exotic spices. Succulent chunks of marinated lamb, basmati rice, fried onions, mint and rose petal � this is one dish that certainly should not be missed. 

We paired our biryani with some fantastic bread, raita and a truly excellent dal makhani. The latter if you�ve never ordered it before is a mixture of slow-cooked black gram, kidney beans with burnt garlic, tomatoes and brown onion. It�s thick, rich, packed with flavour and is a great dish to add a little sauce to any dish and the bread is perfect for mopping up the leftovers. 

To finish, a selection of kulfi on sticks. Rose and pistachio to be exact. Each was such a joy to eat and the perfect way to near the end of our meal. We had such a lovely afternoon at Chakra Little Venice and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for authentic, modern Indian food in a very pretty area of town. The food is punchy, has personality, is traditional and most importantly � it�s all very affordable. Plus the service is excellent. Would we come back? Absolutely!

"HU?: The Home of Fresh, Asian Cooking in Chelsea, London
",https://www.thefoodaholic.co.uk/2022/09/huo-the-home-of-fresh-asian-cooking-in-chelsea-london.html,,"''HU?: The Home of Fresh, Asian Cooking in Chelsea, London 

Located on Park Walk in Chelsea, most famous in the swinging 60s for its hedonistic restaurants and bars and even earlier in 1718 when the Raw Silk Company was located and had planted mulberry trees in the neighboring Chelsea Park (random I know), HU? is one of the street�s newest additions, hosting a menu filled with clean and fresh Asian food. From the bar, expect Asian-inspired cocktails alongside a reduced food menu available for counter dining. I don�t know about you, but I love to sit at the counter and watch the mixologists at work. 

Inside, it�s looking GORGEOUS. Driftwood, perfectly placed lighting, endless timber � it�s perfect for date night, and in the warmer months (or if you�re brave enough in the cold) take advantage of the plentiful pavement dining for a meal or even just a few too many tipples. 

Lucky enough to dine on a relatively warm evening, we took advantage of the sunshine whilst the doors were flung open and tucked into a refreshing glass of Champagne, whilst nibbling on a bowl of finger-licking chili-covered edamame. Not over-steamed and with a good amount of spice � a delicious start. 

You HAVE to order the peppercorn salted prawns because they are absolute heaven! A generously sized bowl filled with juicy, plump prawns, covered in a perfectly golden batter and then sprinkled with fresh chili, spring onions and crispy bits which might have been nuts � but they were so addictive I didn�t take enough notice until they were all gone. If you�re sharing, I recommend two bowls because you�ll only regret it after the last bite. 

Encompassing carefully selected dishes from around China and Southeast Asia, all prepared from scratch using traditional Chinese, Thai, Malay, and Singaporean disciplines � HU? has a cracking menu and includes almost all of my favourite Asian dishes. One of those being black cod and anything in teriyaki sauce. On the menu here is pan-fried teriyaki black cod on a bed of asparagus and with more of that tongue-tingling fresh chili for garnish. The cod was beautiful, well-cooked, absolutely packed with flavour from the teriyaki marinade and the asparagus still holding its bite. It�s not a cheap dish (black cod never is) � but it�s a must order and worth the slightly lighter wallet in the end. 

If you have room, order a side of the Thai aubergine. It�s so fragrant from the moment it�s set down at the table and those aromas follow through in the mouth. The aubergine was roasted to perfection, was so juicy, and had soaked up all of the Thai flavours which exploded in the mouth with each bite. 

Meat lover? I am and what�s better than a crispy duck pancake? Crispy lamb lettuce wraps! I do love crispy duck, but honestly, I love crispy lamb even more so and the portion here for the price was incredibly generous. Strips of juicy, crispy, full-flavored lamb with lettuce leaves for wrapping and hoisin sauce for dribbling over. It�s messy, but worth it � even if you do manage to spill it all down you. 

To finish, a good old classic of banana fritters. It�s everyone�s favorite as a child (and into adulthood) and never seems to disappoint. Very much on the crunchy side here, but still lovely and gave us the sugar rush we�d hoped for and made for the perfect end to our meal. 

We had such a lovely time at HU? and since visiting have been back for bites and cocktails both with friends, loved ones and more recently � meetings. HU? for me comes across as rather health(y)-focused on social media, but don�t let that fool you as they have both healthy and richly satisfying dishes to suit all appetites. Would we come back? We already have and will continue to do so in the future.

"Charlie�s at Brown�s Hotel: Luxury Eating in Mayfair by One of My Favourite London Chefs
",https://www.thefoodaholic.co.uk/2020/03/charlies-at-browns-hotel-luxury-eating-by-one-of-my-favourite-london-chefs.html,,"''Charlie�s at Brown�s Hotel: Luxury Eating in Mayfair by One of My Favourite London Chefs 

Hands up if you ever wanted to stay at Brown�s Hotel in Mayfair? Me, I have! Living in London and around the corner from this beautiful hotel, I do find it hard to push myself to fork out for staycations in London, but it�s something I really should do more often. It�s convenient, if you forget something you can pop back home and most importantly � there�s absolutely no rush to anything. We didn�t stay, but we did visit Charlie�s at Brown�s which is just as exceptional and as much of an experience. Especially so as the menus have been developed by Michelin-starred chef director of Brown�s, Adam Byatt and with Matt Starling (previously Fera at Claridge�s) as head chef. Adam is one of my favourite London chefs and some of my best meals have been at his other restaurant Trinity in Clapham. 

Before I go any further into this review, please can we appreciate just how beautiful it is here? In case you didn�t know, the hotel is part of the Rocco Forte collection and at the forefront of that business is the Polizzi family. I�m obsessed with Alex Polizzi and her TV show The Hotel Inspector/Restaurant Rescue and so I had big expectations and it certainly didn�t disappoint. It�s gorgeous inside and was designed by Alex�s mother Olga Polizzi. The restaurant is also named after the founding Forte, Lord Charles. 

To kick off our meal we tucked into a couple of cocktails as we looked over the menus. A Negroni for me and a Perfect Manhattan for the other half. Both perfectly crafted, heady (just the way I like my drink) and elegant. Especially against the backdrop of the restaurant and table setting. The cocktail menu here comes courtesy of the legendary maestro of cocktails, Salvatore Calabrese and if these drinks are anything to go by � the team at Brown�s seem to know their way around the bar very well indeed. 

Whilst we sipped on those cocktails, we enjoyed some nibbles. One complimentary of radishes with smoked cod�s roe and one from the menu of tempura squid with chilli and garlic. The batter on the squid was thick and more like something you�d see on a Korean fried chicken wing, which I loved. Not to mention the thick smothering of that spicy sticky marinade which was sprinkled with sesame seeds. Delicious. 

One thing you need to be prepared for when eating here is just how indulgent the food is. It�s rich, incredibly satisfying and will be spending at least a week on the hips. For starters we tucked into a Brown�s beef tartare which needless to say, might be one of the best you�ll eat this year, followed by what was probably my favourite dish of the evening � linguine cacio e pepe. The pasta was cooked to perfection, the sauce was as calorific as I hoped for and the shaving of black truffle (optional) on the top meant for a touch of that indulgence I was describing. Two very solid dishes. My favourite tartare in the whole of London is actually at Trinity Clapham by Adam, but this one was still very good indeed. 

For mains, a perfectly prepared sirloin of beef which had been cooked over coals and came simply garnished. I enjoyed the steak a lot, especially those heavenly fries and b�arnaise sauce but if being extra picky � I�d have liked to taste more smokiness in the meat from those coals for extra depth. If I see something telling me how it�s cooked on the menu, I always want to be able to really taste it either in the flavour or the texture. Still, it was a very good piece of steak. 

We also enjoyed a whole 12oz Dover sole which was pan-fried with caper butter. I though the fish was exquisite, in fact I think it was the best piece of sole I�ve had in months. Flaky, juicy and that salty caper butter which poured out from the fish all over the plate left us salivating with every bite. If you come here, order this. 

Little room left, but all in the name of research (that�s my excuse anyway), this blood orange and brown sugar custard tart is a must order � no mater how full you�re feeling. Presentation wise it looked perfect and those lines were so sharp they could have cut through my steak. It also went particularly well with the Australian Viognier we washed it down with. With this tart and that luscious sweet wine, this is one acidity ride I could get very used too. 

The cheese is great here too, although it was missing a cheese trolley. Cheese is big business in London right now and I just love the conversation, smell and excitement that comes with a cheese trolley. All of the cheese we did eat was lovely and those salty crackers were superb, but I just hope a cheese trolley appears soon. They�re already here to present almost all of our other dishes and so I say go all out. This is London after all. 

We finished on some excellent petit fours and took ourselves off to The Donovan Bar next door (also part of this hotel) for a cheeky night-cap. I�m sure you can already probably tell, but we both absolutely loved Charlie�s, right down from the sumptuous decor, polished service, stunning food and most importantly � a longing to return and experience this property fully. I think I knew before visiting Charlie�s that this meal was going to be good as I have so much confidence in Adam�s cooking, but it was so lovely to experience his skills here, in a different environment and cooking style to what I�ve had in the past. Would we come back? It�s a big fat yes from me! '''","My favourite tartare in the whole of London is actually at Trinity Clapham by Adam, but this one was still very good indeed.

"Afternoon Tea Fit for Royalty at Middlethorpe Hall Hotel in York
",https://www.thefoodaholic.co.uk/2020/07/afternoon-tea-fit-for-royalty-at-middlethorpe-hall-hotel-in-york.html,,"''Afternoon Tea Fit for Royalty at Middlethorpe Hall Hotel in York 

Located just two miles from York�s historical city centre and set within acres of beautiful gardens and parkland, Middlethorpe Hall Hotel is the perfect place to enjoy afternoon tea. We were actually staying here at the hotel and having spent a long morning and lunch exploring all that York has to offer, coming back for afternoon tea in the warmth of the property was exactly what we wanted and the history it exudes makes for an even more charming location to enjoy it in. 

One thing you�ll quickly discover when making this short drive to the hotel from York city centre, is just how quiet and peaceful it is. The calm, the tranquility � it�s like stepping back in time. Concierge are also on hand to greet you as you arrive, before whisking you away to your table. This traditional English afternoon tea ritual takes place in one of the grand public rooms or on warmer days on the south terrace. We found a small room next to the main hall and snuggled up next to the fire place as the cold air swooped in from the back doors � it was utter heaven and we had a lovely walk in the gardens just before. 

Price of the tea is a very reasonable �29.50pp for the traditional afternoon tea or �41.50pp for Champagne afternoon tea. We took the latter and sipped on a chilled glass by the fireplace as we waited for our tea and tier to arrive. 

As you would expect in such grand surroundings, the tea looks as if it was fit for royalty and no expense has been spared on presentation. Silver cutlery and tea pots, starch white linen table cloths and a quintessentially British selection of jams and teas to choose from. 

So what can you expect to see on this very generously packed spread? Just about all of my favourites is what. A selection of finger sandwiches (on white or brown bread), including North Atlantic prawn with lemon creme fraiche and baby gem. Coronation chicken. Mature Cheddar with tomato chutney and egg mayonnaise with watercress. The bread was fresh and fluffy, the fillings full of flavour and importantly well seasoned. I can�t stand a sandwich which hasn�t seen a pepper mill. If you�re really hungry and ask nicely, a second helping of sandwiches will quickly appear. 

I�ve had my fair share of scones over the years and these were up there with some of the best. Very large in size, but as crumbly and fluffy as could possibly be, packed with raisins and served with home-made scones with clotted cream and strawberry jam. 

As for the cakes, there�s a lot of them and I loved the selection which was on offer. Ranging from rich and decadent custard pots, strawberry mousse bites topped with fresh cream, to delicate and light mini chocolate eclairs and macarons. I also really enjoyed the slices of cake, particularly the fruity loaf. 

In case you hadn�t already guessed I absolutely loved this Afternoon Tea at Middlethrope Hall Hotel and highly recommend it to anyone looking for something special or even just something delicious. Plus the room it�s served in is the most comfortable and beautiful of settings one could hope for, with so much history and grandeur to it. Would we come back? Absolutely. I�ve not had afternoon tea anywhere else in York, but I�m guessing this is the city�s finest offering.

Master Jamaican Jerk with This Definitive Guide,Master Jamaican Jerk with This Definitive Guide | Saveur,,"''Master Jamaican Jerk with This Definitive Guide 

Learn the best way to get the true jerk experience, from the bold marinade to the smoky, flame-grilled cooking style 

Few Caribbean dishes are as well-traveled, or as beloved, as Jamaican jerk, a humble meal of bone-in chicken or pork parts doused in a blend of spices and hot peppers, and cooked slowly over smoldering pimento wood branches. Peppered across the island, roadside jerk stands entice passersby with wafts of fragrant smoke rising from makeshift grills encased in sheets of tin siding. Supple, juicy, and crispy in spots where the meat has been charred by the fire, jerk is an integral part of Jamaica's economy too, with restaurants like the perpetually busy Scotchies or the relaxed Pepper's Jerk Center serving tourists and locals year-round. It's typically eaten with your hands alongside fried cornmeal ""festivals"" (dumplings), scorching-�hot Scotch bonnet pepper sauce, and cold beer. 

Although jerk comes across as a leisurely beach food, it's actually a dish of resistance, born out of necessity and circumstance. The origins can be traced to the Maroons of the 17th century, a tribe of enslaved Africans who fled into the mountains of Jamaica's eastern Portland parish to escape Spanish-owned plantations. Here, the Maroons barbecued whole wild hogs, burying the meat in the earth to smother the smoke and keep the Spanish and British forces from discovering them. ""They had to live off the land and find ways to survive,"" explains Suzanne Rousseau, co-�author, with her sister Michelle, of Provisions: The Roots of Caribbean Cooking. 

Thanks to the popularity of bottled jerk seasonings such as Walkerswood and Grace brands, the flavors of jerk have become one of Jamaica�s most famous exports worldwide. But Suzanne believes the roots of the dish have been lost. �Jerk is not a seasoning; it�s a type of cooking,� Michelle says. �It�s like whole-hog barbecue [in the American South].� The singular combination of ingredients found on the island, and the technique of smoking with the leaves and branches of the pimento tree (also known as the allspice tree), are what make �jerking� so deeply connected to the island�so much so that it�s become a part of Jamaicans� shared heritage. As Michelle says, �It�s truly tied to our identity.� 

Jamaica-born chef Cheryl Smith�who serves jerk at her Brooklyn, New York, restaurant, Cheryl's Global Soul�says that even if it's not grilled over a smoldering pile of pimento logs, her version is still a tribute to the dish's history, and to the people of the island, past and present. ""It's the ingenuity of Jamaicans,"" she says, ""who figured out how to make something out of nothing. You've got some meat, some vegetables, some wood�and you've got a way to make a living."" 

Making the Marinade 

A common misconception about jerk is that it refers to the blend of herbs and spices the meat is marinated in, but it�s the low-and-slow smoking method that the name actually refers to. Nonetheless, the marinade�a fragrant mixture of Jamaican Scotch bonnet peppers, ginger, garlic, herbs, and spices�is a necessary component. While exact recipes vary among home cooks, some adding more chiles, others leaning more heavily toward fresh ginger and herbs, it�s always a combination of ingredients that reflects the island�s history. 

""Jerk is about balancing all those flavors and ingredients,"" says Jamaica-born chef Andre Fowles of Miss Lily's, a restaurant with locations in New York City, Dubai, and Negril, Jamaica. The recipe can be broken down into three basic components, which work together to create a dynamic, harmonious sauce. 

1. Spice 

The most pronounced element in a jerk marinade (besides the heat) is typically allspice, the round, firm berries of the indigenous pimento tree. Once pulverized, they release a tart, musky aroma with a deeply savory quality. Other spices typically include cinnamon, nutmeg, and lots of coriander, which brighten the overall result. Pungent fresh aromatics, such as ginger, garlic, scallions, and thyme, are ground into the mix to add body and bite. 

2. Heat 

Jerk�s burn comes from Scotch bonnet chiles, a variety of brightly colored hot pepper first farmed by the Ta�no people, the original inhabitants of Jamaica and the Caribbean. In addition to their intense heat, Scotch bonnets are floral and fruity, qualities which are often accented in local condiments by the addition of tropical fruits. Use gloves when preparing them, and remove the seeds�the chiles pack enough punch without them. 

3. Depth 

Some jerk marinade recipes call for bottled browning seasoning, a combination of dark food coloring and concentrated vegetable flavors that Jamaican home cooks and restaurant chefs also use to intensify the umami of stewed oxtails or stewed chicken. Some cooks, like the Rousseau sisters and Cheryl Smith, use naturally caramel-colored, strongly flavored ingredients such as black coffee, blackstrap molasses, Jamaican rum, or soy sauce to build complexity and deepen color. 

Two Ways to Cook Jerk 

To grill or not to grill? Slowly smoking meat using hot coals with pimento branches and leaves is the best way to get the true jerk experience, but you can also get satisfying flavor from a high-heat oven roast. In either case, serve the chicken or pork with lime wedges and some extra marinade on the side. 

On the Grill 

""Good jerk has slightly dry, dark, crusty edges from the heat,"" Suzanne Rousseau says. This, along with the influence of pimento wood and leaf smoke, is the key to jerked meat that tastes like it does in Jamaica. The pimento tree is native to Jamaica, and its hardwood branches, baylike leaves, and dark, wrinkled berries are all important elements in the dish's history and evolution. Named by Spanish settlers in the 1500s after pimienta, meaning ""pepper,"" the tree's peppercorn-like berries are known outside the Caribbean as allspice, which features prominently in most jerk marinades. 

In Jamaica, jerk cooks will layer soaked strips of the hard, slow-burning wood�and occasionally the aromatic leaves�over their grill grates above burning coals before placing whole marinated pork shoulder or quartered chickens on top. The hot smoke gradually imparts the tree's distinct, nutty smoke and oils into the meat as it cooks, adding another savory layer rooted in the Jamaican soil. A good marinade will take you far, but for a proper home jerk, Jamaican pimento wood branches, leaves, and charcoal are available online at Pimento Wood. 

In the Oven 

If grilling is not an option, jerk can be cooked indoors using high oven heat. Since you won�t be getting any smoke, chef Cheryl Smith recommends toasting the whole spices in a dry, heavy skillet until fragrant before adding them to the marinade, lending the finished sauce an additional layer of complexity.

Where did Kue Lapis come from?,Where did Kue Lapis come from? - Elsa Eats,,"'' 
A look at kue lapis and layer cakes in Asia 

Kue/kueh/kuih lapis is an Indonesian sweet snack popular in Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Myanmar/Burma, and Suriname. It�s made using rice flour, tapioca flour, coconut milk, sugar, salt, and food colouring. 

The lapis portion of the name is Indonesian and Malay for �layers�. This is, of course, because the snack has many layers. The word kue takes its name from the Chaozhou/Teochew (??) Chinese pronunciation of the character/word ?, a steamed rice cake. It is thought that the layer cakes in Asia became popular via the introduction of chimney/spit-roasted cakes, also made in layers, which were popular amongst Dutch colonizers in the region (Dutch East Indies). 

When I spoke with my mum, she mentioned that ? is only really used by people in this area and also in some parts of Northern China. That�s not to say that other regions don�t also have steamed rice cakes, but it was very popular in areas of Minnan/Southern Min/Banlam/??? dialects. This group of dialects includes areas such as Fujian, Eastern Guangdong, Hainan, and Southern Zhejiang [1]. Emigrants from these areas will also see the use of this character used in nomenclature, including Taiwan and the places where kue lapis is found. 

The rest of China tends to utilise the character ? instead. In Minnan dialects, this character is mostly used for wheat-based snacks as opposed to rice-based, such as sponge cakes/??. To add to the confusion, kue lapis to most Chinese people from China is literally �nine-layer cake/???�, utilising the character ?. 

Wheat-based layer cakes 

And then there is also the �thousand-layer cake/???�, which looks different in each Chinese region/diaspora region. These tend to be wheat-based, in Indonesia and surrounding areas (former Dutch East Indies). It�s called kuih lapis legit, kek lapis Betawi (Betawi being the old name for Jakarta) but I have also seen it translate as cake lapis and spekkoek (meaning pork belly cake in Dutch, due to the layers). 

There is also the kek lapis Sarawak which comes from the Sarawak region of Malaysia. The layers in this cake tend to be more complex looking more like a kaleidoscope of patterns. The cake is reserved for special occasions due to the amount of effort required to make it. Additionally, kek lapis Sarawak is a protected name for cakes made specifically in the Sarawak region [2]. Any other cakes which look similar can only claim to be Sarawak-style. 

And finally, I�ll bring my own frame of reference to this story of layer cakes in the form of the Hong Kong dim sum style �thousand layer cake�. This cake contains layers of wheat sponge and a filling containing salted egg yolk and custard powder amongst other things. It�s now hard to find this so if you know a place that sells this, go visit!

Katsu is not a sauce,Katsu is not a sauce - Elsa Eats,,"''Katsu is not a sauce. So what is katsu? We look into what the word means presently in the UK and how it came to Japan. 

Katsu is not a sauce 

Katsu is not a sauce. This is a common thought which seems to be concentrated within the UK itself. Australians and Americans do not make this mistake, so I�m not sure how it initially occurred within these shores. I largely put it down to bad marketing as it seems every time a Japanese curry sauce is advertised, it defaults to the term �katsu sauce�. 

A quick look on Twitter under the hashtag #KatsuCurryPolice yields several posts that are disgruntled by this phenomenon. 

What is katsu? 

Katsu (??) is simply the shortened version of the word katsuretsu (????), meaning cutlet. This of course would refer to the fried, breadcrumbed item, and not the sauce. As a variation of croquettes, the dish started in France in the early 1700s but grew in popularity throughout Europe. 

The Polish then brought this idea to Japan during the Meiji era (1868-1912), where a restaurant by the name of Rengatei in the fashionable area of Ginza, Tokyo, served it. [1] Tonkatsu aka pork-cutlet was served with a sauce similar to Worcester sauce, shredded cabbage and rice. 

Aside from tonkatsu, other popular katsu dishes include: 

Katsudon: �pork cutlet-bowl�, a rice bowl with sliced cutlet on top served with egg, vegetables and condiments 

Katsu sando: �pork cutlet sandwich�, a sandwich with a pork cutlet, cabbage, butter and sometimes dijon mustard in the middle 

Katsu kare: �cutlet curry�, cutlet served with a Japanese curry sauce 

Pork is the main meat for katsu, but other items are popular including beef, chicken, prawn, tofu and vegetables! 

The word �katsu� also sounds like the Japanese phrase �to win� (??). For this reason, sometimes people eat tonkatsu before a big event to ensure they win at the task, whether it be a sporting event, a test or an interview. This theme can sometimes be seen in Japanese movies. 

What about the sauce? 

In short, the sauce is just Japanese curry. Katsu is not the name of the sauce. 

The sauce is of course inspired by Indian curries, but it was actually the British who introduced Japan to it, via their colonisation of India at the time. The Japanese adopted a similar way of naming the sauce too, kar? (???), pronounced �kah-reh�. 

Naturally, the sauce was adjusted to appeal to a Japanese palate, so it is milder and sweeter than Indian curries. Apple or honey is sometimes added as a result. 

Japanese curry is commonly eaten with rice (with or without a katsu), udon (a type of thick wheat noodle) or inside bread (akin to a stuffed bread). Obviously, with a katsu, the sauce is added on top. But when it is served without a katsu, additional ingredients include potatoes, carrots, onions and a protein like chicken.

Wazuzhi Dessert Room,Food review of the Wasabi Dessert Room in Manchester - Elsa Eats,,"''
The Wazuzhi (formerly Wasabi) Dessert Room is an amazing dessert room for Chinese desserts.  You have probably passed by it loads of times without realising if you frequent China Town. It is located upstairs from the Wazuzhi Sushi place on Faulkner Street. The best thing about this place? Their opening hours! From 2pm � 9:30pm (last orders 9pm) Monday, Wednesdays adnd Fridays. Saturdays and Sundays 12:30 � 9:30pm. 

Wazuzhi Dessert Room interior 

The interior is quite bright and cheerful with pictures of the desserts along one bright pink wall. I do find the assortment of furniture a bit odd with it largely being stools and tables, then a random sofa at the back. The stools aren�t really that comfortable to sit on but the atmosphere is generally welcoming. 

The Menu 

I really like the menu at the Wazuzhi Dessert Room as they serve a varied assortment of Chinese desserts that I grew up on and more. My favourites are the snow ices and the tofu dessert, the latter of which can be served either hot or cold, with original or ginger syrup. I would not recommend the ice cream mochi as they are really small for the price you are paying. 

Desserts 

What can I say? The dessert here is authentic to the ones I grew up with when I visited Hong Kong. There is a lot of choice from more Westernised waffles and chocolate fondants, to very Eastern soup desserts and tofu desserts. 

My friend Ryo has more to say about the Snow Ice: 

Snow Ice in here never disappoints! For people who don�t know what snow ice is � it�s a cross between sorbet, shaved ice and ice cream. It feels creamier than sorbet but much lighter than ice cream. You can really taste the fruits (or sesame/green tea) in the ice and it doesn�t taste artificial. The accompaniments are also very interesting � it shows a bit of Yin and Yang philosophy. If you order green tea snow ice, then you are more likely to get some red bean on the side. So, you mix something bitter and pallet-cleansing (green tea)  with sweet and nutty (red beans). With more fruit based snow ice like blueberry, you will have some rice cakes to give you a chewy texture and more wholesome flavour. Honestly, it is amazing especially in hot weather or when you need something light after a heavy meal. 

RYO 

Vegan options 

There are vegan options too! Check with the server at the time of order, but when I enquired I was given the following list: 

Grass Jelly Sago with a choice of fruit toppings 
(Grass jelly is very herbal in flavour, almost like bitter tea or cough medicine. Sago is a type of starch) 

Traditional Chinese Tong Shui 
(Tong Shui is a type of sugared soup dessert) 
Sweet Potato with sweet ginger soup 

Red bean sweet soup 

Black sesame paste (a sweetened soup dessert) 

Almond paste (a sweetened soup dessert) 

Tofu pudding (silky tofu in sugar syrup) 

Vegan ice cream (coconut, vanilla, mango or mandarin) which can be served with fresh fruits, coconut jellies, juice balls, bubbles or homemade mochi 

Most of these are highly unusual to a Western palate. If unsure, I�d go with the vegan ice cream option and the tofu pudding if you are feeling a bit more adventurous. 

Overall rating and comments 

8.5/10  -1 for the interior. -0.5 for a lack of Westernised vegan options. It can�t be that hard to make vegan waffles, surely?? I really, really like this place for dessert as it�s unique and has a lot of my childhood favourites. Their opening hours make it a brilliant option for catching up with friends without having to drink alcohol or be in a noisy environment. 

Would visit again?

I really, really like this place for dessert as it�s unique and has a lot of my childhood favourites.
If you order green tea snow ice, then you are more likely to get some red bean on the side.
With more fruit based snow ice like blueberry, you will have some rice cakes to give you a chewy texture and more wholesome flavour.
There is a lot of choice from more Westernised waffles and chocolate fondants, to very Eastern soup desserts and tofu desserts.
I would not recommend the ice cream mochi as they are really small for the price you are paying.
You can really taste the fruits (or sesame/green tea) in the ice and it doesn�t taste artificial.
The Wasabi Dessert Room is one of my favourite places to visit in Manchester! '''
It feels creamier than sorbet but much lighter than ice cream.
So, you mix something bitter and pallet-cleansing (green tea) with sweet and nutty (red beans).

Red Koyla,review of Indian restaurant Red Koyla in Teddington by Andy Hayler in January 2024,,"''Red Koyla (�hot charcoal�) opened in July 2022, run by chef Naseem Qureshi, who had worked for three decades at the Oberoi hotel group in India and also at Sheraton hotels before working at Chatora. Red Koyla is on the main high street in Teddington, with a bar area to the back as you enter. The menu is mostly quite familiar north Indian in style, with a few more exotic dishes. There were three beers on offer: Cobra, Kingfisher and the more exotically named Flying Buffalo, a Punjabi beer made with Himalayan water. The meal began with fried poppadoms and a trio of chutneys, the dried tomato chutney being the pick of these. 

Spinach and onion bhaji flavoured with ginger and coriander was quite pleasant, the fried gram flour casing just a little greasier than ideal (12/20). Aloo channa chaat was a little better, the potato cake at the centre supplemented with chickpea masala, sev and mint chutney. For me there could have been a little more flavour contrast, perhaps from some tamarind chutney, but this was certainly an enjoyable dish (13/20).  

Methi murgh with spinach and fenugreek was nice enough, the chicken quite tender; I would have liked to see more in the way of fresh fenugreek flavour and a slightly punchier spice blend, but this was fine (12/20). Aloo jeera had stir-fried potatoes flavoured with cumin that could have been cooked a little less to my taste (12/20). Stir-fried okra with onion, tomato and cumin avoided the sogginess that often afflicts this dish, but for me the texture of the bhindi could still have been firmer (13/20). Saag paneer was tossed with fenugreek, dill and basil and could have had deeper spinach flavour, as the version of this dish at Dastaan does (12/20). The best dish by some margin was the black dhal, which had excellent texture and a pleasing, smoky taste (14/20). Naan bread was fine (12/20). 

For dessert, mango shrikand was too runny, being more like a custard than a true shrikand (11/20). Gulab jamun was better, the sweet fried dumplings flavoured nicely with saffron syrup and scented with a little cardamon (13/20). Service was excellent and the bill came to �37 a person.  Red Koyla is a capable neighbourhood restaurant with a genuinely classy dhal dish in its locker. If this was near where I lived then I would happily return.

Kanesaka,Review of Sushi restaurant Kanesaka in Tokyo by Andy Hayler in September 2019,,"''
This Kanesaka branch is in a basement in the Ginza, here since 2000; there is also a younger sister branch in the Palace Hotel, and one in Singapore. This shop has trained some fine chefs that have gone on to run their own successful places, including Sushi Saito. Chef Shinji Kanesaka originally started training at Kyubei and after five years at the tender age of 23 he became the youngest employee to stand behind the counter to serve sushi to customers. Five years later he opened his first restaurant. His tableware is from a famous artist called Kitaoji Rosanjin, which is rare and extremely expensive. Apparently he spends much of his savings on the tableware. Seats are arrayed in an L shape around a cypress wood counter, with the chef preparing everything in front of the diners, though there is a little kitchen tucked away behind the scenes to prepare grilled items. There were actually two linked counters, with half a dozen guests being served in our section. 

The meal began with a series of appetisers. Little sweet shrimps with sea urchin were a pleasing way to begin the evening, followed by hairy crab from Hokkaido, which had good natural sweetness. Snapper sashimi followed, then cooked flounder that was removed, steaming hot, from metal skewers. The chef didn�t use gloves to pick up the hot steel skewers, so I presume that his hands are made from asbestos. The best appetiser was bonito sashimi topped with spring onions and a little mustard, the fish beautifully silky in texture. The final appetiser was anago or seawater eel with a little chilli paste, which was quite spicy and went well with the eel. 

The sushi sequence now began. The chef gets his rice from Yamagata prefecture, and the shari (the balls of rice that support the toppings, or �neta�) held together nicely, the rice lightly seasoned with red vinegar and salt, but no sugar. The sequence started with excellent amberjack, followed by akami lean tuna and chutoro, the semi-fatty tuna. Squid was tender, followed by a tiger prawn and then very good herring. My personal favourite horse mackerel was next, and then very good anago with a rich soy sauce brushed onto it. Finally there was a trio of tuna rolls, and tomago, the egg omelette that is the traditional conclusion to a sushi meal.  

The chef was very friendly, speaking excellent English and chatting and joking with his customers. It was nice to experience such a welcoming atmosphere, as some high-end sushi chefs in Japan can be rather austere and forbidding. The bill came to �31,860 (�237) per person, with beer to drink. This was an excellent overall experience, the sushi of high quality and the chef seeming very genuine and charming. This is no longer the most fashionable sushi place in Tokyo, so you can actually get a reservation here without going to extraordinary lengths, but I thought that it was really good and would happily return. The only real issue is the price, but then high quality sushi is inherently expensive.

"Shisen Hanten Singapore
","review of Singapore Chinese restaurant Shisen Hanten, written by Andy Hayler in February 2018",,"''
This restaurant is part of a group, the Singapore branch being located on the 35th floor of the Mandarin Orchard hotel. The other thirteen branches (at the time of writing) are in Japan, spread across Fukuoka, Matsuyama, Nagoya, Takamatsu, Tokyo and Yokohama, where the restaurant empire began. The group was founded in 1958 by Chen Kenmin, a Chinese immigrant. Although trained in imperial Chinese cuisine, his restaurant served Sichuan food, and he popularised this style of cooking in Japan via appearances in various TV shows. His son Chen Kenuchi appeared regularly in the famous TV series Iron Chef. The Singapore branch, opened in 2014, has a third generation of the family in charge of the kitchen, Chen Kentaro. The restaurant was given two Michelin stars in the inaugural Michelin Guide to Singapore in 2016. By contrast, the group�s restaurants in Japan, such as the Fukuoka branch and the Tokyo branch in Akasaka, remain a Michelin free zone.  

The cavernous dining room has a high ceiling and an impressive array of chandeliers. Tables are large and well spaced. The menu is vast, and if you didn't know it was a Sichuan restaurant you would be hard pressed to tell from the menu. Here you will find Peking duck and xiao long bao and a whole variety of Cantonese dishes, but the Sichuan influence remains well hidden on the menu descriptions, other than it offering mapo doufu. 

I was curious to try the xiao long bao, which was certainly very pleasant, the dumpling having reasonable texture, the meat filling decent and served with a vinegar sauce (13/20). Better was siew mai as it was spelt here, the pleated dumpling filled with shrimps, pork, mushroom, scallion and ginger, and lightly steamed, the texture good (14/20). Crab and sweet corn soup was a superior version of the breed, with a generous amount of crab and with a quite thick, broth like texture (14/20). 

I was a bit disappointed by Hokkaido scallops, which had been sliced and topped with peppers and chillies. Hokkaido produces stunning seafood, and so it was sad that the shellfish here had been overcooked. I have had far more rubbery scallops served to me than these in my life, but they were definitely on the wrong side of being correctly cooked. I could still taste some sweetness in the scallops, but between the clunky cooking and the spicy topping the scallop flavour was rather lost (12/20). 

Spicy prawns featured very large prawns that had been carefully stir-fried and had pleasant, sweet flavour, served with cashew nuts and dried red peppers that had a hint of Sichuan peppercorn about them, with its characteristic numbing sensation. It is unusual to encounter prawns of this size that are accurately cooked evenly through (15/20). Bak choy was steamed with garlic and was lightly cooked and tender (14/20). I particularly enjoyed a spicy dry noodle dish that had minced meat sprinkled on top, the noodles having very good texture and flavoured with a good kick of Sichuan peppercorns (15/20). Egg fried rice was fine if unexceptional (13/20). 

Service was rather mixed. The waitresses had clearly been taught to top up drinks carefully, so our tea was refreshed with almost religious zeal, sometimes to the brim of the cup. On the other hand our main waitress appeared fairly forbidding, and did not seem like a natural for the hospitality industry. Our rice arrived late, well after the other dishes except the noodles, and dishes appeared in a rather haphazard order rather than, for example, the starters appearing together. The bill came to S$105 (�56) per person for plenty of food but just jasmine tea to drink. If you drank wine and had dessert then a typical cost per head for dinner might be around �80. If I ignore the Michelin rating, then Shisen Hanten delivered a very pleasant meal with a couple of really good dishes at a rather high price. However two stars for this food is simply crazy. Somewhere like Hakkasan in London blows this away on cooking and service, yet has just one star. It is also particularly odd that the Japanese Michelin shuns the original restaurants, yet the branch over here is awarded two stars. This is just another example of the grade inflation to be seen in Michelin in all too many of its Asian guides.

"House of Ming
",review of Chinese restaurant House of Ming in St James by Andy Hayler in September 2023,,"''House of Ming is a Chinese restaurant owned by The Taj Group of hotels. Head chef was Dickson Leung, who has worked previously at the Michelin-starred Yi Long Court in Hong Kong and at the Shangri La Hotel in Dubai. Pastry chefs Mayank Rajput and Dharma Raj Shrestha, incidentally, competed in the 2023 Bake Off Professionals TV series. House of Ming is a big place, seating 180 diners at any one time, but it is split into lots of smaller sections by wooden screens, so it feels quite intimate in each section. Tables are quite well spaced, though not as large as they might be given that most dishes will be shared. There was background music but it was mercifully quiet. 

There was a set menu at �65 as well as a full a la carte selection. The wine list was not available online but it contained examples like Picpoul Cavede l�Ormarine Selection 2022 at �48 for a bottle that you can find in the high street for �11, Franz Haas Manna Alto Adige at �81 compared to its retail price of �30, and Laurent Perrier La Cuvee Brut at �105 for a bottle that will set you back �48 in a shop. There were posher choices too, such as Domaine Ballot-Millot Criots Meursault of mysterious vintage at �180 compared to its retail price of about �61, and Dom Perignon 2012 at �450 for a bottle that has a current market value of �209.  The use of the Coravin system allows a lot of wines by the glass, including some very prestigious ones. 

We started with a selection of dim sum. The classic prawn har gau was very good, four little dumplings of prawn with delicate, thin casings and ginger and spring onions along with the tender prawn meat (14/20). Char siu bao were light and fluffy buns containing Chinese barbecue pork with a touch of sweetness (14/20). �Scallop golden garlic� was the best of all the dim sum, the dumpling very thin and delicate and the scallop having lovely natural sweetness, enlivened by fried garlic and garnished with Chiniang caviar (15/20). I also tried hot and sour soup, which was better than many, the stock was good and there was a pleasant blend of sourness from the vinegar with just enough chilli kick (14/20).

Sea bass was steamed and served off the bone but with its skin on, resting in a soy-based sauce with chopped red chilli and with a garnish of beetroot. The fish was nicely cooked and the sauce had a pleasing gentle bite to it to complement the soy (14/20). Garlic prawns were quite large prawns that had been deep fried and had surprisingly delicate batter casing with no greasiness, the shellfish inside cooked very well and served with a spicy garlic sauce (easily 14/20). Gai lan was fried with garlic and was also good, bringing some balance to the richness of the fried prawns (14/20). Singapore noodles were unusually delicate and thin, the vermicelli wrapped around pieces of chicken, shrimp and onion and flavoured with curry oil (15/20).

We tried a single dessert, a yuzu mousse disguised to resemble a lemon. The mousse along with lemon compote was inside, the shell made from cocoa butter. This was a neat visual trick, but more importantly, the end result tasted good. The shell was delicate, and there was enough acidity from the citrus to balance the richness of the cocoa but not overwhelm it (15/20).

Service was very good indeed, being extremely attentive and helpful. The bill came to �122 a head with beer to drink, but that was with more food that we could finish. If you shared a modest bottle of wine then you could probably eat for about �95 per person.'''","''Gai lan was fried with garlic and was also good, bringing some balance to the richness of the fried prawns (14/20).

House of Ming is a big place, seating 180 diners at any one time, but it is split into lots of smaller sections by wooden screens, so it feels quite intimate in each section.
Tables are quite well spaced, though not as large as they might be given that most dishes will be shared.
There was a set menu at �65 as well as a full a la carte selection.
The wine list was not available online but it contained examples like Picpoul Cavede l�Ormarine Selection 2022 at �48 for a bottle that you can find in the high street for �11, Franz Haas Manna Alto Adige at �81 compared to its retail price of �30, and Laurent Perrier La Cuvee Brut at �105 for a bottle that will set you back �48 in a shop.
There were posher choices too, such as Domaine Ballot-Millot Criots Meursault of mysterious vintage at �180 compared to its retail price of about �61, and Dom Perignon 2012 at �450 for a bottle that has a current market value of �209.
The use of the Coravin system allows a lot of wines by the glass, including some very prestigious ones.
We started with a selection of dim sum.
�Scallop golden garlic� was the best of all the dim sum, the dumpling very thin and delicate and the scallop having lovely natural sweetness, enlivened by fried garlic and garnished with Chiniang caviar (15/20).
Sea bass was steamed and served off the bone but with its skin on, resting in a soy-based sauce with chopped red chilli and with a garnish of beetroot.
Singapore noodles were unusually delicate and thin, the vermicelli wrapped around pieces of chicken, shrimp and onion and flavoured with curry oil (15/20).
We tried a single dessert, a yuzu mousse disguised to resemble a lemon.
Service was very good indeed, being extremely attentive and helpful.'''"
Stones,review of Fish and Chip Shop restaurant Stones in Acton by Andy Hayler in January 2024,,"''Stones Fish and Chips opened in 2015. It is primarily aimed at takeaway but has a couple of tables to eat at indoors. In late 2023 it was the only London establishment shortlisted for the National Fish and Chip Awards 2024. There is no alcohol license here, but you can bring beer or wine without a corkage charge (but would need to bring your own wine glasses). 

The haddock was fried to order and the fish was carefully cooked, with golden batter that was not too thick. Even at some quite prestigious places the chips can be a let-down, but here they were crisp and well made (easily 13/20). The attention to detail could be seen in the sourcing of the pickled gherkin. The ones used here are Kuhne sweet and sour from Germany, and they are excellent. The tartare sauce was home made and nicely piquant, though mushy peas were nothing special. 

The bill came to �15 per person. Stones is a cut above the normal level of fish and chip shops in London, which for some reason has always struggled to produce high quality fish and chips, especially compared to somewhere like Whitby with Quayside and indeed The Magpie. The best fish and chips I can recall were those made by Simon Hopkinson at Bibendum, but of course that was a much grander affair and anyhow that option no longer exists. Until somewhere of that calibre opens once again, Stones will do nicely.

"Lhardy
",Lhardy (andyhayler.com),,"''
This restaurant has been running since 1839. It was founded by a Frenchman, Emilio Huguenin, and was named after the Hardy Caf� in Boulevard des Italianos in Paris. The owner even changed his name to Emilio Lhardy. His son Agustin Lhardy became a noted impressionist painter, and many of his works hang in the restaurant. The restaurant was the haunt of Spanish royalty, and the famous female spy Mata Hari was arrested at her hotel just after eating lunch here in 1916. 

Lhardy is on a pedestrianised street in central Madrid with a coffee and pastry shop at ground level and the main restaurant upstairs. It is a cavernous place with multiple dining areas and private rooms. A Chinese lamp in one of the dining rooms was a gift from Victor Hugo to the restaurant founder. This is a place that is steeped in history with decor to match. The 25th payphone ever installed in Spain is preserved in one of the alcoves. The current President of Spain dined here yesterday in one of the private dining rooms, continuing a tradition of royalty and celebrities eating here. The menu is somewhat eclectic, with dishes such as Iberico ham and �Madrid stew� but also Wellington sirloin and roast duck from Landes with orange.  

The wine list was joyfully uncommercial. Marques de Riscal Reserva Rioja 2019 was �34 compared to its retail price of �24, an admittedly young Vega Sicilia Alion 2019 was �95 for a bottle that will set you back the same �95 in a shop, and Vega Sicilia Valbuena 5 Ano 2018 was �155 for a wine whose current market price is �167. Chateau Lafleur Pomerol 2007 was �820 compared to its shop price of �625, and Vega Sicilia Unico 2013 at �390 was slightly below its current retail price of �413. 
 
As we arrived, we were greeted by a cup of simple but pleasant meat consomm� that used a stock of ham, chicken and assorted root vegetables (12/20). Another canap� was a bowl of raw carrots and a cumin mousse dip, which was harmless. A speciality of the kitchen is a dish called cocido or Madrid stew. I didn�t order this but it is a little meal in Itself and my dining companions seemed to enjoy it. Classic croquettes made from elements of the Madrid stew had pleasant mixed meat filling but were almost cold when they arrived at the table, rather than being piping hot as they really should be (12/20). 
 
Pate en croute (�23) had quite crude pastry but a pleasant pork interior with a central core of foie gras. I have certainly had more sophisticated versions of this but it was perfectly enjoyable (13/10). Beef Wellington (�34) was better, with nicely cooked beef fillet and slightly undercooked pastry but a genuinely good reduction of the meat juices that had quite deep flavour (15/20). Dessert was a millefeuille (�10), locally called Milhojas. This had good layers of thin pastry and enjoyable vanilla-flavoured cream filling (14/20). 
 
Service was patient and friendly and the bill came to just �75 (�64) per person even including a bottle of Alion 2019, shared between four people. Lhardy is a restaurant with a considerable history and has a menu appropriate to that background. It is not ambitious or ground-breaking cooking but then it is not trying to be. Instead, it offers an appealing menu of classic dishes that are generally well enough made, along with good service and a very fairly priced wine list.

Cura,review of Portuguese restaurant Cora in Lisbon by Andy Hayler in January 2024,,"''Cura (�curator�) is on the ground floor of the Four Seasons Ritz hotel in Lisbon, which dates back to 1959 and features 40,000 square metres of marble. Cura�s head chef is Pedro Pena Bastos, appointed in 2019, and offers menus at �145 (�124) for five courses and �185 (�158) for ten courses. The style of food is �modern Portuguese�, and may include dishes like seafood chawanmushi and amberjack with pepper and tea. The restaurant held one Michelin star in the 2023 guide, the star being first awarded in 2021. Head chef Pedro Pena Bastos had previously worked at restaurants including Geranium and The Ledbury and various Lisbon restaurants including CEIA and Belcanto. The dining room had well-spaced tables and a view into the open kitchen at one end of the room. A local regular diner here arranged this meal and took charge of the wines, so I don�t have any wine analysis in this review. 

An initial snack was a yeast dough base topped with a mousse of smoked eel, fennel and chestnut. The topping had quite silky texture and the distinctive flavour of the eel came through well (15/20). This was followed by Savoy cabbage with red mullet and tiny teardrop peas from northern Spain (an expensive ingredient from Guipuzcoa in the Basque country that can cost 90 euros a kilo or even more). On the side was a dashi stock made from red mullet bones and cabbage. The red mullet had good flavour but for me the best element of the dish was the peas, which had lovely natural sweetness (16/20).  

This was followed by a dish served in two separate bowls. One contained lettuce topped with a generous shaving of Italian black truffles; the other bowl had a foam of roasted onion with a lettuce granita in the form of frozen pearls. This was pretty much peak season for the truffles, which had plenty of musky fragrance, and paired well with the plainer lettuce (16/20).   

A signature dish of the chef was next, squid with hazelnuts, caviar and roasted seaweed with a butter sauce. The caviar was oscietra from Austria, from sturgeons raised in the Alps by a supplier called Alpen Kaviar. The squid was shaped into pasta-like strands in a similar way to the classic dish of Pierre Koffmann, and was tender, the hazelnut adding a contrasting texture (16/20). At this point of the meal, an array of breads appeared, made from scratch in the kitchen, some from �ancient wheat� and all having excellent texture.  

This was followed by grilled sea bass with shrimp, razor clams and cauliflower with a sauce flavoured with sparkling wine laced with wild garlic. The locally-caught sea bass was carefully cooked and had excellent flavour, the clams were tender and the earthy cauliflower made an interesting contrast (16/20).  

The final savoury dish was beef tenderloin from Minhota, a breed of cattle from north east Portugal. The beef was grilled over charcoal and served with rice mixed in with turnips, alongside a little cow tongue, which was slow cooked and had plenty of flavour. The beef itself was lovely, precisely cooked and complemented nicely by the earthy flavour of the turnip (17/20).   

Dessert hinted back to the earlier bread course, with roasted bread ice cream and pineapple along with toasted chocolate as well as a kind of molasses of bread that had been heavily reduced almost to a balsamic vinegar consistency. The pineapple was, I was told, from the Azores, where pineapples were introduced to the islands by Portuguese navigators in the 18th century. This dish for me was in the interesting rather than dazzling category, but was pleasant enough (14/20).   

Coffee was from Honduras, supplied by a local roaster called Senzo and was reasonable if unexceptional. Petit fours included a particularly lovely little orange cake, and a more experimental chocolate truffle with mushrooms and sweet rice. Service was charming and attentive throughout, and the bill came to �240 (�205) per person including plenty of nice Portuguese wine, the star of which was a very good red wine (a Quinta di Lemos 2006 from the Dao region south of the Douro valley) at �110 a bottle. Overall Cura was a very enjoyable experience, with carefully prepared local ingredients and a modern cooking style without venturing too far off the beaten path.

Surinamese Food for Beginners: Where to eat it in Amsterdam,Surinamese Food for Beginners: Where to eat it in Amsterdam (amsterdamfoodie.nl),,"''Surinamese Food for Beginners: Where to eat it in Amsterdam 

Amsterdam is known for its Surinamese cuisine� apparently. I don�t know about you, but in my experience Surinamese and Indonesian food often get lumped in together, and even when you think you�ve ordered the former it turns out to be the latter. It�s not helped by the fact that Surinamese cuisine has been influenced and infiltrated by the cuisines of China, Indonesia, Africa, South America (and probably more besides!) so it�s hard to know what we even mean when we talk about Surinamese food. Plus, while there are plenty of higher-end sit-down Indonesian restaurants, most Surinamese �restaurants� are in fact takeaways. 

After a 15 years living in Amsterdam, I figured it was time to knuckle down and find out where I could find �genuine� Surinamese food � and what best to order when I found it. 

After a 15 years living in Amsterdam, I figured it was time to knuckle down and find out where I could find �genuine� Surinamese food � and what best to order when I found it. By the end of my research, I still can�t say I�ve found anywhere I�d take my friends for an entire evening, and I�m still very far from being an expert on what Surinamese food even constitutes. But then again, that�s perhaps not the point. If you know if anywhere that I�ve missed out on, let me know! 

Best Surinamese sandwiches in Amsterdam 

De Tokoman 

Now with three locations in Amsterdam (on Waterlooplein, Zeedijk and Haarlammerstraat), De Tokoman serves excellent Surinamese sandwiches. The first time I went there, I ordered the broodje pom (a spicy, citrusy mixture of chicken and a root called pomtajer) but I noticed everyone else was ordering the bakkeljauw (salt cod). So the next time, I tried that instead. Nope � still preferred the pom. 

Tjin�s Toko 

While Tjin�s Toko in De Pijp might be better known as a supermarket for Mexican and Southeast Asian ingredients, at lunchtime they also do a great line in Surinamese sandwiches at very reasonable prices. Plus, Tjin�s offers catering � so that�s your next office lunch sorted� 

Best Surinamese takeaway in Amsterdam 

Swieti Sranang 

Swieti Sranang has a couple of branches, both in the Jordaan. Much like de Tokoman, they�re small takeaway joints with a range of hot dishes plus some sandwiches as well (although not as many as de Tokoman, as far as I recall). It was at Swieti Sranang that I was introduced to the concept of bakabana � slices of plantain that have been coated in batter, deep-fried and served with satay sauce. It sounds odd, but it�s very moreish! (Then again, pretty much anything slathered in satay sauce is good�) 

De Hapjeshoek 

Continuing the takeaway theme, De Hapjeshoek � a diner-style eethuis that�s literally inside Waterlooplein metro station � is so packed at lunchtime that you�ll need to queue even if you don�t plan to sit down. It�s more than worth it, though, for food that�s tasty, generous and affordable. One flaky, warm roti stuffed with a curried mix of chicken, potatoes, long beans and sambal will probably feed two people for lunch quite easily. But when the roti rolls are that good (and that good value) why not order the whole one for yourself? 

Best Surinamese restaurants in Amsterdam 

Waterkant 

Better known as one of the biggest beer gardens in Amsterdam, and great for watching the boats go by on the Singelgracht, Waterkant is deluged by crowds every time the sun comes out. With its iconic �carpark chic� vibe, you can�t miss it. And you can drink there, too � hurrah! Surinamese beer, no less. Not everything on the menu is Surinamese (bitterballen and nachos make great beer snacks too, as we know) but there is plenty from that corner of the world to choose from. Think saoto soup, (Surinamese chicken soup), moksi meti (pork belly with all the Surinamese trimmings), roti rolls (see above) and plenty more. 

Warung Spang Makandra 

Now with two locations (one in de Pijp and one in West), Warung Spang Makandra is great if you�re on a budget, as almost all items on the menu are less than �15. There are plenty of Javanese-Indonesian options: the beef rendang and ayam pedis (spicy chicken) are both fantastic. But for something more authentically Surinamese, try the roti. At Spang Makandra, they present you with the constituent parts (in my case: chicken on the bone, stewed lamb, a boiled egg, green beans, potatoes) and you roll it up yourself in the fluffy, spiced, nutty roti wrap that comes with it. H�erlijk!

Romance by lamplight: Vuurtoreneiland,Vuurtoreneiland: review of the island's winter restaurant (amsterdamfoodie.nl),,"'' 1 march 2018
Romance by lamplight: Vuurtoreneiland 

I�d been wanting to go to Vuurtoreneiland � the tiny lighthouse island just off Durgerdam, north of Amsterdam � ever since I read Curry Strumpet�s blog post about it in 2016. Back then, Vuurtoreneiland�s pop-up restaurant of the same name was only open in the summer months, but it�s since expanded to offer a winter version as well. So I did what every normal person in a relationship does at Christmas: I gave a dinner experience that I clearly wanted for myself to my other half as a present. He wasn�t getting the hint, ok? 

lit with lanterns, candles and log fires, and with sheepskin rugs thrown over chairs for extra cosiness, Vuurtoreneiland certainly ticked the romantic box 

We were picked up by boat from the Veemkade just opposite the Lloyd Hotel. The reservations book must�ve been full to bursting the chilly night in February that we�d booked to go, because the seating arrangements were verging past gezelligheid to personal-space invasion on the boat. But it didn�t matter � we had a glass of organic pear cider, bread with dips and curried cauliflower piccalilli, and plenty of wine. And luckily we are quite small people. 

After just under an hour on the IJ, navigating around islands and past locks and sluice gates, we arrived at our destination in the pitch dark. It was one of the few occasions I�ve been able to see stars in Amsterdam. We were given hurricane lanterns to light our way while we made a brisk circuit round the island to the restaurant itself. It�s housed in a sort of bunker whose former use I missed, but I�m assuming it was something war-defence related. At any rate, 

lit with lanterns, candles and log fires, and with sheepskin rugs thrown over chairs for extra cosiness, Vuurtoreneiland certainly ticked the romantic box. 

Food-wise, you get the feeling Vuurtoreneiland is well aware of its environmental impact. As the island has no electricity or running water, food is cooked using old-school wood and fire, while cutlery and glasses aren�t changed between courses to save on water usage. And the menu has a clear local, seasonal message that�s heavy in vegetables and sustainable protein. Our meal started with three amuses: salsify chips with puffed mustard seeds that had a proper vinegary kick; beetroot crackers that were both earthy and fresh; and parsnip cooked two ways with a creamy mayo dip. The latter was my favourite of the three, but I liked them all. 

Next came what I keep describing as a carrot party: these bright, patriotic root veg had been treated in various different ways from raw to roasted, and served with a salty, umami-rich seaweed powder. It was palate-poppingly good. Our final vegetable dish was kohlrabi: parts fermented, parts roasted, and with both the roots and the leaves used to full effect. Again, the umami flavour was intense and satisfying. 

Perhaps my least favourite dish, while still good, was the fish � a variety of whiting called steenbolk that was served with fermented celeriac and a pur�e that could�ve been a pumpkin-celeriac mix. While the herb oil formed a nice contrast, the rest of the dish just tasted (and smelt) a bit too fishy to really enjoy. 

The only meat dish was a take on the traditional Dutch slavink. But this was a far cry from the sausage-y wodges of pork you see in the supermarket. Using all parts of the pig, the rich gamey taste of the meat was offset by sweet-and-sour red cabbage confit. 

Dessert called itself zoethout (liquorice), which concerned me as I�m generally not much of a fan of anything aniseed. But in this case it was accompanied by so much cocoa and coffee that it was perfectly palatable and a great way to end the meal. 

Of course, we both fell asleep in a food-and-wine coma on the boat ride back, which made cycling home afterwards all the more challenging. But it was a memorable four or five hours that really stood out for being different to your average night out in Amsterdam. Dinner at Vuurtoreneiland will set you back �100 per person in winter, but it includes the boat trip plus all wine pairings with your six-course meal, so the cost-to-value ratio is certainly high. And it makes a great gift � even to yourself�

Posted by WORLDSBESTFOODBLOG on MAY 22, 2021 

Reminiscing on my travels of the past year(s), thinking on all the fun places I have visited. Understanding I am one of the lucky ones in this world. Looking outside now, at the grey weather and the +1 year celebration of lock downs and closed restaurants� Boy am I counting down the days! 

Also, the this is the name of the restaurant� not the score, just so that you know this upfront�hahaha 

So last year, in February 2020 I was still on the world exploration tour, visiting Australia and NZ, but also one of my favorite countries in the world: Philippines and the capital Manila.. (see earlier posts for other lovely places). Strolling down the Guijo street in Makati, looking for this place, it was not that easy. But the hardest searches have the biggest reward? Or something like that  

Overall, the service was a bit poor to be honest� it was a very cold and windy seat as well� but the vibe was amazing. Young and rich locals trooping together, typical for one of the poorest cities in Asia� Average monthly salary being spend here for 1 dinner! 

And nr.1 frustration: The tasting menu was not available for this food critic !! Only a la carte� 

Very nice mondain and metropolitan type of restaurant and menu in particular. Fun cooking, experimental fusion menu with some extraordinary ideas. I got surprised but never blown away. Still, I enjoyed the meal for sure. 

Worst part for me, was the pace. Even after asking to slow it down, 8 course dinner was done in under 75 minutes�. slow for Asia, too fast for me! 

I will give you some pictures of the food, that will paint the picture. Guess what is it? Or scroll all the way down for explanations. 

And I finished with a crazy dessert, without picture it seems or it got misplaced� 

Made out of: 

Coconut sorbet, lemon, black sesame, corn, peccorino (!) and rye�. something special! 

In the end, paid a lot, enjoyed it, but will not be back. Cannot explain why�. Either way, try it out yourself!

Posted by WORLDSBESTFOODBLOG on AUGUST 7, 2020 

Hey Hey, guess who�s back�??!! 

After almost 6 months of Corona pause, some time for reflection and rethinking where to go with my blog, I came to the conclusion I could not miss you guys 

I have had many requests about why I was this quiet, still having hundreds of restaurants I visited before corona up my sleeve? I think I just needed a short break and focus on my day-job as well� But as I secretly managed to go on a quick 6 day trip to the Amalfi coast last month, I have found some places I just had to share online! 

So I went to the place that might have had the best terrace view IN MY LIFE! https://www.capri.it/it/c/le-grottelle 

What a stunner, what a place. The best Italian food? Nope, tourist trap? Nope! Genuine good food, just lovely, but as always on holidays, the food just taste better on location. And over here, after a 45 minute walk uphill, you know you found a hidden gem in between the lovely mountains of Capri. And the first view you get is this: 
 
Without reservation, and because of Corona, without tourists (made me so happy!) we had the best place of the restaurant, with lovely view all around the island: 

As it was lunch, and after some days of eating 4 time a day (you are a foodie or you are not, just 6 days, had to taste it all�). We decided to go for some locals but also real classics. Next time we should try the rabbit, it must be amazing as well. 

You can not go to Capri without a Caprese Salad !!! You just cannot do that! 

Peperoni ripieni )stuffed peppers with eggplant, olives, Emmental and basil) 

Spaghetti Aglio e olio e peperoncino 

So in a nutshell, what an amazing place, nice wine, super friendly service and after all: A very reasonable price for one of the most expensive islands in the world. I would have thought prices were at least double. Now we paid for this lunch, including wines and �coperto� just 48 euro! That�s a bargain�. 

And for me the dessert was the amazing walk back for 1 hour with astonishing views! Just unbelievably pretty! My lovely wife did not like it as much� but it is give and take in any relationship, correct?

"Liburnia, Pristina Kosovo","Liburnia, Pristina Kosovo � Worlds Best Food Blog",,"''Liburnia, Pristina Kosovo 

Posted by WORLDSBESTFOODBLOG on JANUARY 5, 2020 

Any of you ever been to Kosovo?! Why not? Because I think it is beautiful, as most countries are in that area. Much more modern than you can imagine, way better developed than some Western European countries. And with very nice traditional food, still at honest pricing. You can eat and drink like a king over here. 

My good friends from Pristina pointed me to this restaurant as being the higher level of real traditional food; 

This is the type of restaurant where you just have too much on the menu but still want to try it all� But first you need to find it  

The atmosphere is simply amazing, but than comes the menu�. this is hard, this is impossible, so I said bring a bit of everything�. but the waiter stopt me in time. I honestly wanted 7 or 8 dishes and taste all the bread types, but it was not possible, too much food waist. So I had to pick just 4 and 2 types of bread. What would you try? 

I ended up with some cold cheese soup, tasting like Ayran! Very soft, a bit milky with fresh parsley, great opening. Followed by the local Liburnia salad, grilled eggplants and local cheese (very salty!!), also some chicken fillet with apricots and chilies (loved the combo but why the linguine??) And why 3 fillets? Less is more. Also had to taste the meatballs in garlic yoghurt (NJAM!!). 

And do not forget the 2 big breads (this was the small portion of 1 euro per bread). 

Stuffed, as always. Washing it down with a local wine called Budraumi Vieter� but to be honest, this was not the best part of the evening. That was my company! 

Lovely Eliza, my contact in Kosovo, entertained me all night. We had lovely discussions about life and food, so thank you Eliza for the great night out. She only hates to be on pictures�. got 1 hahaha. But I will keep it small not to attract too much attention  

In the end all drinks, coffee, liquor food and all the fun cost me 46 euro�. what a dream.

La Yeon,review of Korean Seoul restaurant La Yeon by Andy Hayler in April 2017,,"''La Yeon (""Celebration"") has been open since 2013, located at the top of the Shilla hotel on the 23rd floor. As you might hope, there is a fine view over the city from the dining room looking out over the pretty Namsam Park. Chef Sung Il Kim prepares Hansik (Korean) cuisine in a style reminiscent of a Japanese kaiseki menu, with a number of different styles of dishes culminating in rice as the final savoury course.

The room has large, generously spaced tables with crisp white tablecloths. There was a choice of two tasting menus, one at KRW 160,000 (�112) and a longer one at KRW 250,000 (�175). They were very flexible about being able to substitute dishes between these. There was a lengthy wine list with plenty of depth in the classic regions of France, but also a good selection of New World wines too, albeit with very heavy markups. Example labels were Christian Moreau Chablis 2015 at KRW 100,000 for a bottle you can find in the high street for KRW 22,140, Clos du Val Chardonnay 2013 at KRW 170,000 compared to its retail price of KRW 43,411, and Trimbach Cuv�e Frederich Emile 2006 at an outrageous KRW 320,000 for a wine that will set you back KRW 43,411 in a shop. There were also prestige bottles like Chateau Palmer 2006 at a KRW 1,100,000 for a bottle whose current market value is KRW 265,676 and Mouton Rothschild 1982 at KRW 7,000,000 compared to its retail price of KRW 1,687,724. It can be seen that even the high-end bottles are marked up more than four times their retail price.

The meal began with seaweed crackers and dried dates. The crackers were actually quite delicate (14/20). This was followed by a warm chestnut broth covered in a layer of chestnut powder. This was unusual but very pleasant, and certainly the flavour of the chestnuts came through well (15/20). This was followed by a prettily presented chilled pen shell salad with yuzu garlic sauce. Pen shell (called tairagi in Japan) is a type of mollusc, resembling a cross between a scallop and a clam, and tasting like a slightly firm scallop, still with some pleasing inherent sweetness, the acidity of the yuzu sauce bringing a nice balance (16/20).

Next was sea bream and beef dumpling with mugwort sauce. The latter may sound like something out of Harry Potter but is actually an aromatic herb with a slightly bitter flavour. The dumpling was fine but nothing remarkable; in terms of delicacy it would not compare well to one at (say) Hakkasan, but was nice enough (14/20).

Red mullet was served in a bed of radish and cabbage with red bell pepper sauce and a garnish of oyster leaf. There was notionally a hint of spice in the sauce, though this was subtle to the point of invisibility, and the mullet itself was cooked correctly but it did not have the lovely flavour that this fine dish can possess (just about 14/20).

Tilefish (also called amadei) was grilled and served with grilled aubergine, onion and fried Korean Angelica, along with a side salad with sesame oil dressing. There was also a little dish of kimchi on the side, no Korean meal being complete without that. Tilefish in a top restaurant in Japan can be a glorious thing, having a slight sweetness, its delicate flavour resembling lobster. Here it was merely pleasant, the other components a reasonable accompaniment, the kimchi not overly pungent (14/20). I had chicken with a sauce of onion and soybean, also with fried Korean angelica (wild celery). The chicken was cooked properly did not have a great deal of flavour, the sauce decent enough (barely 13/20). My wife had sea bream with anchovy and red bean pepper paste, Korean mountain herb, radish, soya soup, and white kimchi with pear. The fish was fine, accurately cooked, the kimchi quite punchy in flavour (14/20). The traditional rice dish in this case came with beef tartare and an array of pickles including garlic. The beef had surprisingly little flavour, though the pickles were enjoyable (13/20).

A pre-dessert was red ginseng with rice alongside tofu ice cream, green bean pur�e, and red beans marinated in brown sugar. I don't think the pastry sections of three star French kitchens will be trembling at the thought of the competition from this (12/20). Cold cinnamon tea came with a Korean rice cake with mugwort, red bean paste, walnuts, pine nuts and a Korean orange called hallabong. This was harmless enough, the walnut flavour coming through nicely (12/20).

Service was excellent, with a helpful female sommelier who had trained in Beaune. Topping up was faultless throughout, and the staff spoke very good English, which was a bonus. The bill, with a bottle of Guigal Gigondas between us, came to KRW 273,999 (�192) each. To be honest this felt like an awful lot of money for what we had, though certainly the setting and service were hard to fault. It was a pleasant enough meal if you set aside the absurdly high expectations set by its utterly incomprehensible three star rating from Michelin. However this is an awful lot of money for what we had, however nice the view and the service.'''","''Cold cinnamon tea came with a Korean rice cake with mugwort, red bean paste, walnuts, pine nuts and a Korean orange called hallabong.

There was a choice of two tasting menus, one at KRW 160,000 (�112) and a longer one at KRW 250,000 (�175).
Red mullet was served in a bed of radish and cabbage with red bell pepper sauce and a garnish of oyster leaf.
A pre-dessert was red ginseng with rice alongside tofu ice cream, green bean pur�e, and red beans marinated in brown sugar.
I had chicken with a sauce of onion and soybean, also with fried Korean angelica (wild celery).
It was a pleasant enough meal if you set aside the absurdly high expectations set by its utterly incomprehensible three star rating from Michelin.
The chicken was cooked properly did not have a great deal of flavour, the sauce decent enough (barely 13/20).
There was also a little dish of kimchi on the side, no Korean meal being complete without that.
The latter may sound like something out of Harry Potter but is actually an aromatic herb with a slightly bitter flavour.
Tilefish in a top restaurant in Japan can be a glorious thing, having a slight sweetness, its delicate flavour resembling lobster.
The bill, with a bottle of Guigal Gigondas between us, came to KRW 273,999 (�192) each.
The fish was fine, accurately cooked, the kimchi quite punchy in flavour (14/20).
The traditional rice dish in this case came with beef tartare and an array of pickles including garlic.
This was followed by a prettily presented chilled pen shell salad with yuzu garlic sauce.'''","''La Yeon (""Celebration"") has been open since 2013, located at the top of the Shilla hotel on the 23rd floor.
 Chef Sung Il Kim prepares Hansik (Korean) cuisine in a style reminiscent of a Japanese kaiseki menu, with a number of different styles of dishes culminating in rice as the final savory course.
 There was a choice of two tasting menus, one at KRW 160,000 (�112) and a longer one at KRW 250,000 (�175).
 They were very flexible about being able to substitute dishes between these.
 There was a lengthy wine list with plenty of depth in the classic regions of France, but also a good selection of New World wines too, albeit with very heavy markups.
 The meal began with seaweed crackers and dried dates.
 This was followed by a warm chestnut broth covered in a layer of chestnut powder.
 This was unusual but very pleasant, and certainly the flavor of the chestnuts came through well.
 Next was sea bream and beef dumpling with mugwort sauce.
 The dumpling was fine but nothing remarkable.
 Red mullet was served in a bed of radish and cabbage with red bell pepper sauce and a garnish of oyster leaf.
 Tilefish (also called amadei) was grilled and served with grilled aubergine, onion and fried Korean Angelica.
 I had chicken with a sauce of onion and soybean, also with fried Korean angelica (wild celery).
 Service was excellent, with a helpful female sommelier who had trained in Beaune.

Palais Coburg,Palais Coburg restaurant review 2009 October Vienna | French Cuisine | food guide | Andy Hayler,,"''Palais Coburg is a luxury hotel in a grand building in Vienna dating back to 1864. The main restaurant is in a conservatory in the grounds, nestling under the impressive pillars of the hotel.The dining room is L-shaped, with a stone floor and glass walls and ceiling. A five course menu in the evening is EUR 65, EUR 98 with wine pairing. If you take the a la carte route then starters are EUR 7-14, mains EUR 14-25, desserts EUR 4 for each mini-dessert that is taken, or indeed each choice of cheese.

The wine list is immense, 145 pages of close-typed choices, representing a cellar with 5,000 separate bins and 65,000 bottles.Examples are Jermann Vintage Tunina 2005 at EUR 92 compared to a retail price of EUR 30, Trimbach Pinot Gris 2004 at EUR 44 for a wine that you can buy for around EUR 15 in the shops, while at the higher end of the list Opus One 1985 was EUR 420 compared to a shop price of about EUR 200, and Antinori Solaia 1986 at EUR 245 for a wine you can buy for around EUR 153. Some of the finer wines appear in literally dozens of separate vintages. The bread, which is made on the premises, was served warm and consisted of slices of white, brown and dark rye (16/20).

I began with a salad of veal and celery, which worked well, the crunchy and distinctive taste of the celery a nice earthy counterpoint to the veal, the good salad leaves having a celery-flavoured dressing (16/20). Beef tartare was served with tofu and cep mushrooms and a garnish of carrot.This was quite a light dish, despite the presence of the beef, and was pleasant (15/20).

I was more impressd with a veloute of duck, fluffed up and having strong duck flavour, carefully seasoned and served with a pair of crisp duck samosas on the side; the key here was how well the flavour came through (17/20). Cod was carefully cooked, served with a slightly spicy ravioli of chorizo and potato and cream of green bell peppers. The peppers were a welcome lift to the slightly bland cod; the bell pepper flavour came through strongly, and again the seasoning was good (15/20).

I enjoyed the main course of pheasant, one piece braised and the other pan-fried. This was served with pumpkin gnocchi and champagne cabbage. The pheasant had excellent flavour, especially the slow-cooked version, and the cabbage was a nice foil to the richness of the pheasant; the gnocchi was just a little heavy, but overall this was an excellent dish, enhanced by a rich red-wine sauce of the cooking juices (17/20).

Desserts here arrive the old-fashioned way, on a trolley. I tried a rich chocolate cake, apple and hibiscus shortcake with white chocolate, and (since I was in Vienna) the apple strudel. These were all nicely made, though not outstanding (15/20). Petit fours consisted of a little plum cake and a pistachio cake, both moist and with good texture (16/20).

Service was extremely good throughout the evening, friendly and helpful. The bill was EUR 123 per person, including the wine pairing and service.The chef is now Martin Kammlannan, the previous chef Christian Petz having left in late 2008. Overall I found this a very enjoyable meal, with an appealing menu and careful cooking.'''","''A five course menu in the evening is EUR 65, EUR 98 with wine pairing.
